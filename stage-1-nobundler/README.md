### Notes

* we need 4 elements to start:
    * a scene
    * an object
    * a camera
    * a renderer

### Scene

* like a container
* we put objects, models, lights in it
* at some points, we ask 3JS to render that scene

### Camera

* create a camera
* adjust camera translation (position)

### Renderer

* create canvas
* add canvas to the renderer
