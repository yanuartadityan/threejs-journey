## THREE JS Journey

This is my journey to complete awesome course from [Bruno Simon](https://threejs-journey.com/).

## Where am I now and what motivated me

I started to learn OpenGL few years ago, using some C/C++ GL-based APIs, e.g. PCL and OpenCV. Really enjoyed working with 3D, for a brief moment, I realized that 3D graphic programming has its own world. Never touch it again once the project ended...

And in 2014, I encountered a modern HTML5 presentation slider, [impress.js](https://impress.js.org/#/bored). For the first time, I encountered how HTML5 (+CSS3) allowed you to render 3D in web. 

In 2015, I started an interest towards data and I've been using [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) to visualize data. I did not spend so much time on it since it is pure JavaScript which I suck at it...

Beyond this, I have became Python guy. Still into data, switching alot between Matlab and Python for analysis and visualizing my data, but always impressed on how 3rd party libraries keep growing and growing in Python-world. Here, enter [plotly](https://plotly.com/). An awesome graphing library that allows viewers to be interactive with the plot! This is way beyond any plotting libraries I've ever been using at this time.

Then I realized that Plotly have been using plenty of D3.js, but taking a thread from my first experience with OpenGL, WebGL is taking modern 3D visualization in your browser by storm. To know and understand how to use [three.js](https://threejs.org/) is enough motivation to join this course!
